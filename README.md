This is a full-stack web application for performing predictive analytics. The application uses a Python backend for data processing and machine learning, and a JavaScript-based frontend for the user interface, allowing users to interact with predictive models through their web browser.

To start the application, first run the backend server with the command 'python manage.py app.py'. 
Then, in a separate terminal, start the frontend development server using 'npm start'. 
You can then access the application in your web browser, typically at a local host address.
