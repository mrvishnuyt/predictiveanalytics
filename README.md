# Predictive Analytics Web Application

This is a full-stack web application for performing predictive analytics. The application uses a Python backend for data processing and machine learning, and a JavaScript-based frontend for the user interface, allowing users to interact with predictive models through their web browser.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Follow these steps to start the application locally.

### 1\. Start the Backend Server

In your terminal, run the following command to start the Python server:

```sh
python manage.py app.py
```

### 2\. Start the Frontend Application

In a **new terminal window**, run the following command to start the frontend development server:

```sh
npm start
```

### 3\. View the Application

Once both servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by the frontend server (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
